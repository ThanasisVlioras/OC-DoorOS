## DoorOS

DoorOS is an operating system for the minecraft mod OpenComputers.

Its EFI is in an early working state and the operating system for now is just a nice UI that prints the contents of the root filesystem. Use arrow keys to "select" another file / folder in the menu. You cannot do anything else.
